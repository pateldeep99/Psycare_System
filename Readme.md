# 🧠 PsyCare – Psychological Care System

## 📋 Overview
**PsyCare** is a web-based psychological care and self-assessment platform designed to identify an individual's mental health status through an online quiz curated by professional psychologists.  
Using **PHP**, **Laravel**, **Python**, **Flask**, and **Machine Learning**, the system predicts whether a person requires psychological treatment and provides appropriate guidance, meditation suggestions, and doctor consultation options.

Developed as a **Final Year Capstone Project (B.E. Computer Engineering, 2021)** by **Deepkumar Patel and team**, this project combines technology with psychology to promote mental wellness and early diagnosis.
